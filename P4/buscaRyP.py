1. Initialize a priority queue with a node that includes all articles.
2. While the queue is not empty, pop the node with the highest area from the queue.
3. If the node is a leaf (no more articles to consider) and its area is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum area and the corresponding articles.
4. Otherwise, generate two children nodes: one including the next article (if it fits and doesn't overlap with the existing ones), and one excluding it.
5. Calculate the bound (maximum possible area) for each child. If the bound is greater than the current maximum, push the child into the queue.
6. Continue the process until the queue is empty or the maximum possible area is not greater than the current maximum.
7. Return the maximum area and the corresponding articles.
